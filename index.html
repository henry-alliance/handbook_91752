        <li id="r14">Henry Hierarchy</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Henries ranks are determined by their number.</li>
            <li>The lower the number the higher they rank.</li>
            <li>The lower the number the more OG they are (ex: Henry 1).</li>
            <li>Honorary Henry is lower rank than Henry.</li>
            <li>Rankings of the position Henry 1, 2, and 3 can only be changed by a meeting of the Henry.</li>
            <li>Honorary Henry rankings CAN change.</li>
            <li>Honorary Henries can be any number but #1 is the Supreme Honorary Henry and is allowed at the meetings of Henry. They may help the goings ons with the Council of the Henry and rule over all the Honorary Henries but must always know their place.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li id="r15">Meeting of the Henry</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>All Henries will attend meetings of the Henry. When a meeting of the Henry occurs, and whether it is online or in person, is up to Henries 1, 2, and 3.</li>
            <li>When all Henries are at the meeting of Henry (Unless you can't come) all Henries will dicuss problematic issues and then after the issues have been resolved, they will proceed to vote on the new Henry 1.</li>
            <li>The positions of Henry 1, 2, and 3, are not permanent; each Henry 1, 2, and 3 will each have one month to be in that position. At the meeting of the Henry, everyone will vote on who to be in the Henry positions of 1, 2, and 3 as well as who becomes Supreme Honorary Henry.</li>
            <li>To get voted for, you must have a campaign and a speech, and Honorary Henry 1 will count all votes and announce who has gained the positions of Henry 1, 2, and 3.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li id="r16">Welcoming an Honorary Henry</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The candidate must have every part of the Henry vibe and do an aerial trick (unless it's unreasonable for whatever reason).</li>
            <li>You must be able to imagine the candidate being named Henry. If there is absolutely no way you could possibly see them being named Henry, they may not become an HH.</li>
            <li>Assign them a number (Rank).</li>
            <li>Honorary Henries cannot be assigned an already taken number (ex: if someone is already Honorary Henry 3, the new Honorary Henry cannot be assigned as Honorary Henry 3).</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li id="r17">NO NO NO WORDS</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>IF YOU SPEAK THE NO NO WORDS, YOU WILL BE EXILED (after four warnings).</li>
            <li>Instead, you may say things like "OH MY HENRY!", "HOLY HENRY!" or "WHAT IN SUPREME HENRY'S NAME!" as an appropriate alternative.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li id="r18">NO BEING SUSSY</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>You shouldn't say sus things like "D*ez N*ts", "Y*ur m*m".</li>
            <li>If you say these things anyway, you will be exiled after a certain number of warnings depending on the sussy-ness of the thing you say. If you’re just saying “Y*ur m*m,” your exile is extremely unlikely, and will be determined by at least one Henry from the Council of Henries. Meanwhile if you say something more severe such as “D*ez N*ts,” you could be exiled after your 6th warning or so.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li id="r19">Council of Henries</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The council of henries consists of Henry 1, 2, 3, Honorary henry 1, 2, and 3.</li>
            <li>The council has absolute power, think of it as the supreme court.</li>
            <li>The council when solving problems will vote on what all henries should do, example: we are in a food shortage we come up with 3 answers, 1. Stop eating 2. Don’t each as much 3. Only eat at home. We would vote on whichever answer is best in our opinion which ever answer has the most votes, we choose as the solution, if we are tied in a vote (ex: 3 votes on option 2 and 3 votes on option 3, we remove the answer with the least amount of votes and revote after trying to convince each other) thus is the rule of court.</li>
            <li>All laws of the USA (United states of america) are upheld in suing, voting, crime cases, and daily life. (With the exception of some rules, please contact Honorary Henry 1 or Henry 1 if you have any questions please ask if the law still is in effect)</li>

        <li id="r20">Geography Skills</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Every Henry and HH must know at least 1 country on Earth (it can be any country, even countries not recognized by the United Nations, ex: Taiwan and the Cocos Islands)</li>
            <li>Pronounce the word "geography" anyway you like, but it is preferred by the Supreme Henries for you to pronounce it "ge-og-ra-phy".</li>
            <li>You must be able to place all of the conutries, states, provinces or districts of a specific continent or country, ex: China, North America, Russia, Australia.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li id="r21">Bad Opinions</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Bad opinions are opinions that are terrible and do not comply with our agenda.</li>

            <li>If you have any one of these opinions, you will be warned or demoted by how terrible your opinion is.</li>
            <li>The only people who shall change any of these bad opinions into ok opinions are the elder Henries and Supreme Honorary Henry.</li>
